However, remember to NOT rename the index.qmd etc. files, as that interferes with the seamless rendering process and the blog will not be updated as you render.\n\nDragging and dropping images still does not work. It would be really convenient if this could be rectified.\n\nSometime in the near future, I need to refresh my Rmarkdown code wrt to stylistic features, so I can do away with the default blog visuals.\n\n**Zotero**\n\nI downloaded Zotero and the Safari plugin, and it seems to work fine. It syncs with R and with Microsoft Word, and my brief tests don't raise any issues.\n\nI do have to note that most articles downloaded from Google Scholar do not contain DOI information, so this is something I still have to add in manually.\n\n**Github Desktop**\n\nDownloading this was the easy part. Committing to changes and publishing/pushing was also not too difficult to figure out.\n\nThe only roadblock I've faced thus far is obtaining the blog URL. After setting the output directory to docs, I get a message saying that the pages failed to be built? I'm not sure how to fix this.\n\nI've noticed also that, while I've downloaded Github Desktop, I can't seem to get the \"Create a git repository\" option when I start a new project in RStudio. An hour of Googling and troubleshooting has gotten me nowhere, so I'm stumped for now.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Setting up the Techymabobs","author":"Bram Goh","date":"2023-01-26","categories":["tech"],"image":"image.jpg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
